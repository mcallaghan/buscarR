Description: When we do machine learning-prioritised screening in a systematic review, we 
  can only save work if we have a method for deciding when to stop. 
  buscarR offers an implementation of the stopping criteria we suggested in 
  Callaghan, Max, and Finn MÃ¼ller-Hansen. 2020. 
  Statistical Stopping Criteria for Automated Screening 
  in Systematic Reviews. Systematic Reviews, September.
